C - Doubly linked lists ðŸ“ƒ 0x17-doubly_linked_lists
About this project:

In this project i learnt and practiced;

    What is a doubly linked list
    How to use doubly linked lists

Tasks file descriptions:

    lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.

    4-free_dlistint.c: C function that frees a doubly-linked dlistint_t list.

    5-get_dnodeint.c: C function that locates a given node of a doubly-linked dlistint_t list.

    The parameter index is the index of the node to locate - indices start at 0.

    If the node does not exist - returns NULL.

    Otherwise - returns the address of the located node.

    6-sum_dlistint.c: C function that sums all the data (n) of a doubly-linked dlistint_t list.

    If the list is empty - returns 0.

    Otherwise - returns the sum of all the data (n).

    7-insert_dnodeint.c: C function that inserts a new node at a given position.

    The parameter idx is the index of the list where the new node should be added - indices start at 0.

    If the function fails - returns NULL.

    Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.

    Requires compilation with functions defined in 2-add_dnodeint.c and 3-add_dnodeint_end.c.

    8-delete_dnodeint.c: C function that deletes the node at index index of a doubly-linked dlistint_t list.

    The paramter index is the index of the node to delete - indices start at 0.

    If the function fails - returns -1.

    Otherwise - returns 1.

    100-password: Text file containing the password for the crackme4 executable.

    102-result: Text file containing the largest palindrome made from a product of two three-digit numbers.

    103-keygen.c: C function that generates passwords for the crackme5 executable.

    Usage of the crackme: ./crackme5 username key

    Usage of the keygen: ./keygen5 username
