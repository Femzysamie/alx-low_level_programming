C - Hash tables ðŸ“ƒ 0x1A-hash_tables
About this project:

    In this project i learnt and praticed;
    What is a hash function
    What makes a good hash function
    What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
    What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
    What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
    What are the most common use cases of hash tables

Task files and descriptions:

    hash_tables.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions.

    0-hash_table_create.c: C function that creates a hash_table_t hash table.
        If the function fails - returns NULL.
        Otherwise - returns a pointer to the new hash table.

    1-djb2.c: C function that implements the djb2 hashing algorithm.

    2-key_index.c: C function that returns the index at which a key/value pair should be stored in the array of a hash_table_t hash table.

    3-hash_table_set.c: C function that adds an element to a hash_table_t table.
        The parameter key cannot be an empty string.
        Returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise.

    4-hash_table_get.c: C function that retrieves a value associated with a key in a hash_table_t hash table.
        If key cannot be matched - returns NULL.
        Otherwise - returns the value associated with key.

    5-hash_table_print.c: C function that prints a hash_table_t hash table.
        Prints each key/value pair in the order they appear in the array of the hash table.
        Does not print anything if the hash table is NULL.

    6-hash_table_delete.c: C function that deletes a hash_table_t hash table.

    100-sorted_hash_table.c: C functions that define a sorted hash table shash_table_t.
        Identical in function to a hash_table_t hash table except key/value pairs are inserted in alphabetical order according to the ASCII value of the key.
        Key/value pairs are printed in the order they are sorted.
        Includes a function shash_table_print_rev() that prints the hash table in reverse order.
