About this project :

In this project i learnt and practiced:

    Makefiles and how to use them
    Explicit and implicit rules
    Setting variables

Task files description:

school.c

    C function that displays a seahorse in text,for Makefile practice purposes in project.

main.c

    Main C function that runs the function defined in school.c.

m.h

    Header file defining the function prototype used in school.c.

1-Makefile

    Requirements:
        name of the executable: school
        rules: all
            all: builds your executable

        name of the executable: school

5-island_perimeter.py

    Python function that returns the perimeter of an island defined in a grid.
    Prototype: def island_perimeter(grid):
    The parameter grid is a list of a list of integers.
        Water is represented by 0.
        Land is represented by 1.
        Each element of the lists represents a cell square of side length 1.
        Grid cells are connected horizontally/verticaly (not diagonally).
        The grid is rectangular, with a width and height not exceeding 100.
        The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is either exactly one island or nothing.
        The island does not contain lakes (water inside disconnected from surrounding land).

100-Makefile

    Requirements:
        name of the executable: school
        rules: all, clean, oclean, fclean, re
            all: builds your executable
            clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
            oclean: deletes the object files
            fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
            re: forces recompilation of all source files
        variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM, CFLAGS
            CC: the compiler to be used
            SRC: the .c files
            OBJ: the .o files
            NAME: the name of the executable
            RM: the command to delete files
            CFLAGS: compiler flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
        The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
        You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files
        The clean, oclean, fclean, and re rules should never fail
        You have to use $(RM) for the cleaning up rules, but you are not allowed to set the RM variable
        You are only allowed to use the string $(CC) once in your Makefile
        You are only allowed to use the string $(RM) twice in your Makefile
        You are not allowed to use the string $(CFLAGS) (but the compiler should still use the flags you set in this variable)
        You are not allowed to have an $(OBJ) rule
        You are not allowed to use the %.o: %.c rule
        Your Makefile should work even if there is a file in the folder that has the same name as one of your rules
        Your Makefile should not compile if the header file m.h is missing
